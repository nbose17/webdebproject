## Authentication

The application uses mock authentication for Phase 1. Any email/password combination will work for login. In Phase 2, this will be replaced with real backend authentication.

## Mock Data

All data is currently stored in `lib/constants.ts` as mock data. In Phase 2, this will be replaced with API calls to a backend.

## Notes

- Phase 1 is frontend-only with mock data
- Authentication is mocked (no real backend)
- All CRUD operations work with local state/mock data
- Payment forms are UI-only (no actual payment processing)
- QR code is generated client-side
- Images are placeholder/mock images

## Phase 2 (Future)

- Backend integration
- Real authentication
- Database integration
- Payment processing
- Image uploads
- Email notifications
